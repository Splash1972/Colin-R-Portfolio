Week Two Homework

I've experimented doing this in several ways.  
I tried using the project from week one, and reverse engineering the code to my liking.  That ended up being a big mess.  I tried starting from scratch, but everytime I refreshed the local browser, it kept asking if I wanted to translate from French to English, and I don't know why this was happening.  I used the html5 shortcut in a new html document, but this kept happening.  I copied the first few lines from the week one project and pasted them, and this fixed the problem.  I still don't know how or why this was happening.

At this point, I am just going through the week two classes to see what bits of code I want to try.  I've scheduled a tutoring session to help with some of the layout issues I seem to be having.


After countless tries, I have finally gotten to a place where I think I'm ready to submit for feedback.  I'm sure the flow will come to me as I keep doing these projects, but for now it's a struggle, but satisfying.
